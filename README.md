### Hellow fellow internauts

I like to code, but for some reason I tend to read about all more that to implement it. Weird thing in general... but this second semester of the year, I'll be more proactive. So, wait for some cool not so much cool things!

I'm SE at an awesome mexican company [Yellowme](https://yellowme.mx/). Also I'm a co-admin of [JavaScript Merida](https://www.facebook.com/pg/javascriptmerida), you occasionally we create events for devs. I play wow (warrior fury) and currently I'm falling for mechanical keyboard so my wallet is dying.
